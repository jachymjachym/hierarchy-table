# Ataccama Hierarchy Table

So this is my solution of the HierarchyTable task. Please note that I was trying to take the easiest way and make it ASAP, so there is a lot to improve. 

Here are some things, which could possibly improve development, architecture and performace (in case of larger scaled app):

### Typescript

Typechecking could be done with typescript instead of PropTypes

### CSS modules

Components should better use CSS modules with sass or styled components to avoid globaly imported styles

### Linting

App most likely has some longer lines or wrong indents

### Hierarchy table code

Code could be a little bit less spaghetti. Functions would deserve to be separated in files
